          together; it's a hub of activity, friendship, and fun. And now, as the
          owners of hypixelreps.com, we have decided to create a website that
          handles 3 forms of verification in one, offering a convenient and
          streamlined experience for our community. Come join us and see for
          yourself why we are the best Hypixel Skyblock Discord server and
          website out there!

        <div class="a1">
          The measures in place to verify user identity include using a captcha
          to confirm they are not a robot, making it difficult for alternate
          accounts to join by requiring multiple verifications, linking
          Minecraft and Xbox accounts to confirm identity, and implementing
          anti-cheat systems for a fair gaming experience. These security
          measures are aimed at creating a safe and secure environment for
          players.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="q2">Why do I have to verify?</div>
      <div class="a2">
        You don't have to verify if you don't want to, but by doing so you are
        helping to protect the security and integrity of our server.
        Verification helps us prevent potential raids, hacking attempts, and
        takeover attempts by unauthorized entities. By verifying, you ensure
        that you will be able to access and view our server without any
        disruption. It's up to you, but we highly recommend verifying to
        maintain a safe and secure environment for all users.
